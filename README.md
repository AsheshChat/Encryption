# Substitution Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program

This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates encryption and decryption using a substitution cipher. Please note that this is a basic example for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world encryption needs. Substitution ciphers are not secure and can be easily broken.

## How the Program Works

The program takes a message as input from the user and encrypts it using a substitution cipher. It then decrypts the encrypted message to obtain the original plaintext. The substitution key used for encryption and decryption is provided within the program.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the C++ source code file.

2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

3. Run the compiled executable:./encryption_decryption


4. Enter the message you want to encrypt and press Enter.

5. The program will display the encrypted message and then decrypt it to show the original message.

## Important Note

- The key used in this program is not suitable for secure encryption. It is simply a permutation of characters used for demonstration purposes. For secure encryption, use strong and well-established encryption algorithms like AES or RSA.

## Customization

You can modify the substitution key to create your own encryption and decryption schemes. Remember to use the same key for both encryption and decryption to ensure the message can be recovered correctly.
